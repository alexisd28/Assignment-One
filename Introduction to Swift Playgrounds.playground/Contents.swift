//create 2 new variables of type integer

//We are going to create a statement that compares the two variables and assign that statement to a third variable

// This is Boolean variables, they have only two values, true or false
//Part 7 Own Your Own Part 1:

var mySixthVariable = myFourthVariable == myFifthVariable

//Part 8 Own Your Own Part 2
